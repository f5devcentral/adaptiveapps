# Adaptive Applications Cookbook

This repository contains recipes and examples to help F5 customers realize the benefits of adaptive applications.

## What Are Adaptive Applications

Adaptive applications utilize an architectural approach that facilitates rapid and often fully-automated responses to changing conditionsâ€”for example, new cyberattacks, updates to security posture, application performance degradations, or conditions across one or more infrastructure environments.
And unlike the current state of many apps today that are labor-intensive to secure, deploy, and manage, adaptive apps are enabled by the collection and analysis of live application and security telemetry, service management policies, advanced analytic techniques such as machine learning, and automation toolchains.

Specifically, adaptive applications allow you to:
1. More rapidly detect and neutralize security threats
2. Improve application performance and resilience
3. Speed deployments of new apps
4. Easily unify policy across on-prem, public cloud, and edge environments
